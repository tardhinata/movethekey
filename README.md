Move The Key
==========================

My old small project, 2D Java game without game engine. 
Initially made as part of my bachelor lecture "Programming (Java)" assigment.

Developed using AWT and Swing component, so as you may notice its not really library made for game.
But since its just a part of lecture and we dont need to perform heavy computation for this kind of game (rendering, collision detection, etc), that will do quite nice :)
